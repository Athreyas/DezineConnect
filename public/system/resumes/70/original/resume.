Vishwajeet started his career in advertising and one day woke up to realize and wanting to do what he loved most… “Photography”. It took him to Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design, London, UK and London College of Fashion, London, UK to study photography.

Then started the process of creating images.

Vishwajeet has assisted photographers like Tarun Khiwal in India and Sante D’Orazio in New York, USA.

He has contributed to various magazines and recently his work has been exhibited at the “The Art of Fashion & Intermix Gallery” in Chelsea, New York, USA.
