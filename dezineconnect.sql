At the age of 31, the designer is creating waves with t-shirt designs that are being picked up by youth across the country.\r\n\r\nThe youth are generally perceived as the ones who squander time, money, and resources recklessly. So, it is a real pleasure when one hears of somebody who breaks the stereotype by channeling the youthful spirit into something constructive.\r\nMeeting the likes of Neil Dantas, one is happy to see a young man breaking the aforementioned stereotype.\r\n\r\nBorn and brought up in a South Mumbai chawl, Neil’s social status may read as lower -middle class, however his thoughts defy these traditional forms of social classification as his efforts demonstrate a line of thinking of the highest class and order.\r\n\r\nA Post-graduate in Industrial Design from the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, Neil is better known today for his line of graphical design t-shirts that are a rage with the young across the city. The 31 year old designer designs graphical t-shirts that are fun and creative, yet have an underlying but dominant message on a social issue.\r\n\r\nThe story of the graphical t-shirts started in 2006, when the Mumbai train blasts prompted Neil to set up a blog – www.thedoers.blogspot.com, with a bunch of his neighborhood friends. They also came up with a t-shirt, with a design on iron handles depicts of a local trains of Mumbai and with the words inscribed “we still holding on”. The t-shirt went on to become a rage among the young, which encouraged Neil to take up further projects. And the rest as they say is history.','2010-04-20 06:33:43','2010-08-24 22:46:25','6451_1200568779592_1389740336_561828_4771041_n.jpg','image/jpeg',44525,'2010-04-20 06:33:43','Today if I am anywhere, it is because of somebody’s goodness. Everybody has something wonderful to share with themselves and with others.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'4138','Another of Neil’s popular designs was the t-shirt he came up with after the November 26 terrorist attacks in the city. Says Neil, “After the attacks, there were several designs going around that said ‘We hate terrorism’ or ‘We want peace’ and other such messages. “We wanted to come up with a different concept, one that was fun and gave out a strong message at the same time.” Thus, a few of the t-shirts that they designed include one that had Mumbai’s map in red colour that depicted a speaking mouth and an empty rectangle, another said ‘What can you DO’?, and some others with similar patterns.\r\n\r\nWhen asked why t-shirts in particular as a medium to inspire people, Dantas explains, “There is no doubt that other mediums such as movies and photographs are effective ways to inspire and educate the society but I wanted something that the youth can connect to and get inspired from. The look also should add the fun element.”\r\n\r\nSo what makes Neil feel so strongly about social change?\r\n\r\n“I have always been inquisitive; even as a child I asked many questions, and discussed several issues which most people dismissed as non-serious. That could also be because of my habit of observing a lot. Not having enough money for even public transport, I would walk to most places. From the Gateway of India to Flora Fountain in South Mumbai, everything fascinated me and I wanted to know the story behind it. I observed everything and everyone around me,” recalls Neil adding that what irked him the most however was everybody’s pessimistic attitude and his family and friends telling him that ‘there was no point in discussing any issue since nothing would happen’ or that ‘if nobody’s doing anything, why do you want to’.\r\n\r\n“From all these conversations, if there was one thing I took away was that one needs to earn money and empowerment to bring about real change,” says Dantas, who himself has faced quite a financial struggle. After the death of his father in 1999, he worked with a Christian cemetery, painting crosses, earning Rs 20 per cross. He recalls that the person who hired him was himself not in a great financial position, yet continued to give him work and supported him in every way including giving him advice and direction.\r\n\r\n“Today if I am anywhere, it is because of somebody’s goodness. Everybody has something wonderful to share with themselves and with others. In the same way, I see my designing skills as a way to bring about social change” says the young lad who prefers to call himself a socially-awakened youth rather than a social activist.\r\n\r\nHe believes that each one needs to start somewhere rather than just dreaming and this is possible and If ‘each one adopts the policy of working towards change for the purpose of development’. Inspired by the British, Neil appreciates the way they implemented town planning keeping in mind future requirements of the city. “Unfortunately, due to the vested interests of a few, Mumbai is now losing its identity” sighs Neil who strongly opposes a divide and rule policy and believes that ‘Mumbai is for everyone, Maharashtra is for everyone, and India is for everyone and that anybody, be it an Indian or a foreigner in India is a part of the nation – a part of the whole – like pixels making up a complete picture.\r\n\r\nIsn’t he afraid of being interpreted wrongly?\r\n\r\n“People hesitate to talk and discuss about things which are wrong. We can only come out of fear if we talk and discuss with people. I want the people of Mumbai to speak out and stand up against that which is wrong without any fear,” says a determined Neil adding that “Our country is not poor and yet we’re going nowhere. Today, global designers are coming into India which is great but why can’t we also spread out our contemporary Indian designs and ideas in the global market?”\r\n\r\nWhich is why he came up with concepts like “FORGET superman TRY ME\" and the “I am the BEST (connotative of Mumbai’s local bus services)” to promote local culture. Explains the fiery youth, “Who are these superheroes we endorse on t-shirts? Has anyone seen them? Why do we wear t-shirts that say ‘I Love New York’? Why not talk of India, of ourselves first? Lets be proud of what we have”\r\n\r\nOn the personal front, Neil’s ideas and concepts are not limited to graphical t-shirts. He is expanding his work and has deigned bags, jewelry and the latest he has designed is furniture. “The furniture is designed in the shape of a bus ticket which one gets in Mumbai’s local buses. I am aiming to talk about waste management through the same” explains Neil.\r\n\r\nThere are several other issues such as AIDS,global warming and others that Neil is working on. His latest campaign is called ‘Kuch Bhi’ which encourages youth to break free of societal norms to spread social awareness. The campaign will be identified through a red form over a yellow background and Neil hopes that it is picked up by young people across the country. For now, we can only wish him the very best in all his endeavors and expect to see more and more young people wearing the ‘Neil Dantas’ t-shirts.\r\n\r\n*JAM (just a minute…)*\r\n\r\n*What is the best moment of the day?*\r\nWhen I get up early in the morning and I get this feeling that I have one more day in this world.

To most people, the mere mention would throw up visuals of scary creepy crawlies that make one jump. But not to Neha Ramaiya, the 32 year old Mumbai based artist who chose to dedicate the name of the pottery club she founded to these eight legged creatures – YellowSpider. Then again, Neha isn’t exactly your usual girl next door.\r\n\r\nHer rebellious streak is evident from the first time you introduce yourself as is her refusal to not mince words. One realizes that Neha is not even one for political correctness when she shares her belief that the real reason she was failed by her teacher in her first year as student at the JJ School of Art was because she wanted to take up ceramics and not painting as the fear of this particular teacher who asked female students to pose for paintings, which she didn\'t want to pose ever.\r\n \r\n“I’ve been a rebel for as long as I can remember. I never took kindly to people trying to establish any sort of dominance or supremacy over me – be it my family, my teachers or my employers” shares Neha.','2010-05-02 22:37:17','2010-08-24 12:45:09','Neha_profile.jpg','image/jpeg',53619,'2010-05-04 23:27:33','Neha Ramaiya, founder of \'YellowSpiders Pottery Club\' is no shy artist. A lady with a purpose, Neha has struggled her way up through several riff-raffs and experiments to finally settle down to the pride of having started what is today, Mumbai’s fastest growing pottery club.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'3006','It is perhaps this need to be the master of her own destiny that also ruled Neha’s decision to start her own venture instead of joining the corporate rut. A Post-graduate in Ceramic and Glass Design from the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, Neha admits that she dabbled in several jobs before finally realizing that she wasn’t truly satisfied by any of it. Extrapolating, she says “While helping a friend with her jewelry exhibition, there was a sudden spark of inspiration that made me wonder why I couldn’t do my own thing too. Uncannily, during the same period I met a potter-artist who proposed that we hold a joint exhibition.” While the exhibition eventually fell through because of lack of funds, the two got together to come up with the idea of pottery classes. Thus was born YellowSpider.\r\n\r\nNow nine months and 43 students old, \'YellowSpiders Pottery Club\' is veering towards the tag of one of the fastest growing pottery clubs in Mumbai. A growth that the founder attributes to their philosophy of “promoting a stress-free environment where students should be able to have fun and enjoy learning without the fear or frustration.”\r\n\r\nGoing back to our original thought about including the word Spider in the name, Neha shares that the story goes way back to when she was in class nine, “I like spiders as their cells are in golden proportion, defined by the number Phi. Few know it, but spider cells are of equal ratio. Red being my favorite color, the idea was to call my club ‘Red Spider’, however, the song ‘Yellow Submarine’ by the Beatles playing in the background inspired me enough to seal the decision that whenever I have a studio, it’ll be called \'YellowSpiders\'.\r\n\r\nCreative indeed! So did she always know that she wanted to have her own studio?\r\n“Way back in 1997, two of my classmates started their own studio. As much as I wanted to join them, they did not allow anybody to be a part of it. It was then that I knew that I will do something of my own” reminisces Neha adding that she does not look back upon these incidents in a negative way, “If anything, they made me discover that I am not a loner, rather I am content in myself. I used to have a very few selected friends in Mumbai, sometimes wondering if I was anti-social. It was in New York at the age of 21, while roaming the streets one day that I realized that I am just happy being the way I am.”\r\n\r\nRamiaya claims that it was at NID that her world changed. “For the first time, I managed to connect with so many people on the same wavelength. NID in a way opened up many opportunities in my life and was a turning point of sorts for me.”\r\n\r\nWhen did she realize her inclination towards the arts?\r\n“I think it was in class seven when my drawing teacher appreciated my work. Of course, I was so taken in by that small bit of praise, that I failed class nine because I was bad at maths and more inclined towards art” laughs the artist.\r\n\r\nNot being deterred by failure seems to be a trait she imbibed a long time ago, as she adds nonchalantly that she also did not clear the first year of college. “It took a while for me to realize that it wasn’t ‘Arts’ that I was interested in but “Fine Arts’ that was my calling.” Not that it was all smooth from thereon. Far from it, Neha’s father prevented her from taking admission to the JJ School of Art as he felt it was too far from home and did not think it right for a girl to travel so much.\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise then that Neha received little or no inspirational support from the family for her creative pursuits. Yet, the youngest of four siblings, she has worked her way around to get exactly what she wants in life. “After high school, I took up admission at the JJ School of Arts, submitting a leaving certificate from the previous institute.” All without informing her family! “I told them only after I actually joined the course” adds the rebel.\r\n\r\nIf the above incidences give rise to any doubts about Neha’s sincerity, it is only her passion for YellowSpider that one needs to revisit to give rest to all such uncertainties. For not only is she currently working to see her club grow but is also pursuing a PhD in Design Thinking to further hone her aptitude. Her zeal for pottery is evident in her belief that she can reach out to all types of people, even those with no background in the arts, in support of which she says, “My desire to teach comes from my experience as a communicator, I have learned to find and stimulate the artist in us all, regardless of our experience of art.”\r\n\r\nHer words instill confidence. What has been her inspiration, given that every artist usually has one?\r\n\r\n“A novel I read in 1993 called Illusions by Richard Bach had a quote which has stayed on with me till today. It said, ‘You are never given a wish without been given the power to make it true. You may have to work for it however.’\r\n\r\nWe wish for Neha and \'YellowSpiders Pottery Club\' the power to grow in leaps and bounds!\r\n\r\n*JAM (just a minute…)*\r\n\r\n*What is the best moment of the day?*\r\n5 o’clock in the evening.

But like every other child genius, once his parents realized his capabilities, they wanted him to excel in academics and sent him to a boarding school in Lucknow. Fortunately for Rahul he could keep alive his interest in drawing and sketching while there and it is because of this that he is able to call upon boarding as one of the most interesting phases of his life “If nothing else, I sharpened by drawing skills by drawing biology diagrams for my classmates.” \r\n\r\nThe real change for Rahul came about in class 12 when he moved to Kanpur. He explains the move, “Almost everybody at the boarding school was academically ambitious and wanted to be an engineer and get into the IIT’s. It was sometime in class 9 that a chance mention by one of my teachers about her son applying for a fashion design programme at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), made me aware of the existence of Fashion Design courses.

Even after a lot of discussions, Rahul had to end up taking Physics, Chemistry & Maths at Kanpur University and decided to wait his turn after graduation. “My sister had recently moved to New Delhi after her marriage, hence after BSc I ran away to her place. I met a few people at NIFT who suggested I take the entrance exam of the National Institute of Design (NID).”  \r\n\r\nAs expected, Mishra cleared the entrance for both institutes and eventually took up admission at NID where he shone as a star student, going on to graduate with the “Best Student Designer of the Year” award in 2005 and followed it up by winning the “Pride of NID” in 2006. \r\n\r\nAfter creating waves on the Indian Emerging Designers scene, Rahul went on to be the first non-European designer to win a prestigious scholarship at the Istituto Marangoni, Milan where he pursued a Masters in Fashion Designing.

It was inspired by his visit to the museum located at Trivandrum and gave him an understanding of ancient Kerala clothing. “In ancient Kerala the lifestyle and clothing was entirely dependent on the caste, profession, religion and occasion. The draping style and the border color used to vary according to the class the wearer belonged to. This project has been a sincere effort towards creating awareness and bringing Kerala handicraft on the center stage of global scenario to employ and empower weavers of rural Kerala. The idea is to enhance the experience of tourists through appropriate and comfortable clothing. Clothing plays a big role in cultural exchange. It will help in strengthening cultural identity of Kerala. Subsequently, a strong tourism industry will uplift overall economy of the state,” extrapolates Rahul of his ambitious project. \r\n\r\nThis collection has turned out to be a product of research, exploration, sketches to finally filter down to ensembles in the collection “REVERSIBLE”, outfits that can be worn inside out.\r\n\r\nWhile Indian designers are increasingly turning westward, Rahul is promoting Indian handlooms and handicrafts. He strongly believes, “Our Indian weavers have great potential which can be used to create wonders. I like bringing the best work from different regions together. You can see traditional Indian handlooms and handicrafts in my designs.\r\n\r\nIn order to promote the Kerala and to give back to the society, Rahul is also working on the community development and Kerala handlooms and crafts project. It will help in developing the Apparel training and production centers, tourism and other cultural exchanges and retails and export market.\r\n\r\nApart from Kerala he has been closely working with Benarasi handloom (U.P.), Chikankaari (Lucknow), Chanderi (M.P.), Maheshwari and Khadi (M.P.), Bandhini and Bhujodi Shawls (Gujraat), Bhagalpuri handloom (Bihar), Double Ikat (Orrisa)\r\n\r\n_Rahul Mishra, with his conviction, grit and an overflowing bank of creativity, will definitely take India places.”\r\n--SOCIETY MAGAZINE_\r\n\r\nThe winner of several international and national awards, was recently featured in the eminent list of 20 young Indians, who are transforming India for INDIA VISION 2020... the list includes likes of Rahul Gandhi, Chetan Bhagat and Abhay Deol etc. In 2006 he was winner “Fiesta Italiana Fashion Design Talent Hunt,” and also rated as Best Debut by publications like Elle, Times of India, Hindustan Times etc, amongst many more, Rahul sums up his achievements in his vision of fashion:\r\n\r\n“Fashion is a mere continuous hypothesis of perfecting and enhancing the body. Ultimate truth lies in genuine feeling of wellness.”\r\n\r\nThe latest collection on which finished working was THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT (Showcased at Wills India Fashion Week A/W ‘10/11). The unique collection showcased in India Fashion Week has been rated, as one of the best collections of the season in India for its modern feel.\r\n\r\nThe innovative graphics seek to portray the journey of the human race and the process of metamorphosis our planet has undergone in the last century.\r\n\r\nThis collection is doing exceedingly well in India and abroad, the collection was showcased in BOI (Best of India) section at Singapore Fashion Week in April and recently in first week of May was showcased at prestigious “India – Sweden: Cultural Collaboration through Contemporary Art and Fashion” an event organized by the cultural ministry of Sweden.\r\n\r\nTHE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is already going places and making waves in the international fashion scenario, it will be available some of the best stores across the world.\r\n\r\n','Interview','designs.rahul@gmail.com','+91 22 2496583','','',NULL,'rahul.mishra7','','','','','','','*JAM (just a minute…)*\r\n\r\n*If there were one person for whom you would like to design a thing.

I thanked the unknown, who had devised that machine. Thereafter I started wondering how everyday products came into being and wished, someday I would be a creator of products too. \r\n\r\nAfter graduating as an electrical engineer I have worked as a journalist, been a socio-cartoonist, designed sets for food festivals until I donned the \'industrial sculptor\' avatar! \r\n\r\n2005 saw the beginning of my self initiated project: Useful Art – desirable everyday objects! \r\n\r\nI am first trying to build up my identity, the philosophy of \'differential design\' and its application.

',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2926','*Useful art - If we see Art at one end and design at other end, where would useful art fall?*\r\nI end up proposing monolithic, organo-mathematic sculptures which in no way look industrial but artistic. That’s why I call my self an Industrial Sculptor!\r\n\r\n*Process that is taught in design schools vs. the process that you follow. How is it different?*\r\nAny design institute will take students through a design process and guides them along that path. However, designers need to develop their own techniques, methods, processes and ideologies.  \r\n\r\n*How do you actually get the idea of designing something?*\r\nEveryday products, they are so numerous and ubiquitous. They form the material framework of our existence, enabling it to function, not only in practical or utilitarian terms, but also in ways that give pleasure, meaning and significance to our lives. \r\n\r\n*But why don\'t we notice them?*\r\nMost of us travel by the same route everyday, do similar tasks everyday, go to same places and although we are awake and seeing things around us we are not actually looking at them consciously. Hence, such products are frequently taken for granted. \r\n\r\nDesign, to my understanding, is all about having an eye for such details and bringing back life to mundane objects. \r\n\r\nI practice voluntary simplicity. It is about freedom. It is about wanting less. It permits one to spend less time on innovating features (which land up adding clutter) and more time bringing in new experiences, insights, and relationships between the product and the user. It is rather difficult to say much about my approach towards design, but I have a fascination for monolithic, mono-colored \'organo-mathematic\' forms and whatever needs I have felt and observed I have tried to translate them into products. \r\n\r\nThe Indian consumers are price sensitive and prefer to buy value for money products. I am inspired by people\'s behavior and experience — physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and cultural. I am trying to kill elitism in design and bring the best to the maximum number of people. Raise the quality! Down the price! \r\n\r\nMy basic intention of being a designer is to give birth to new thoughts and I need people to question and criticize my products. Moreover, I believe in open source, I  don’t like to keep my designs to my self. Hence an online portfolio is the best way of getting feedback from the people.\r\n','Interview','differentialdesign@yahoo.com','+91 9899302457','differentialdesign','http://www.differentialdesign.blogspot.com',NULL,'pages/PAUL-SADIP-designer-of-everyday-objects/122488651107061?ref=ts','paulsandip','','','','','','*Your wife is from a similar field, so is the competition coming from home, or is it challenging to have a like-minded person around?*\r\nBeing a toy designer, my wife Suhasini carries a lot of design sensibility with her. She is my best critic. She helps me choose the right CMF (color, material, and finish) for my designs as well!  There is no competition amongst us but we make sure we both together give the rest of the design community a good competition! \r\n\r\n*How do you define your style?*\r\n“Voluntary Simplicity.”\r\nOff late, I am trying to create ‘formlessness’ and still keep the product for interpretation, and let people use it in their own way. I want to break away from this form, function, form beyond function and form follows function. \r\n\r\n*Have you ever thought of getting your products manufactured?*\r\nMy Mug has been displayed in the Museum of Modern Art, MOMA. And is currently traveling to a lot of global destinations as part of the exhibition by INDEX: design to improve life, Denmark. I never had a thought about manufacturing and selling, but off-late people are showing interest in investing in my products…so let’s see what comes up.\r\n\r\n*Where do you see industrial design stand in India?*\r\nWe lack people interested in manufacturing original products. Probably the business impact which design can bring it yet to be realized. Let’s stop re-creating stuff and be original. I think the design mark which India Design Council is working on will help. \r\n\r\n*Apart from the traditional skills, what new skills/attitudes should product designers have in order to survive and grow today?*\r\nFor a product designer, sketching is a very important skill. If designers can sketch out concepts in front of their clients, it showcases their originality and thinking.\r\n\r\nVisual communication and presentation skills are needed as designers need to sell their concepts within the team as well as other teams. The storyboards or portfolios should have less written content. They should have rich images that talk about the products and their contexts of use. They should create world-class presentations in grand style. \r\n\r\nSelf discipline is a must. It reflects in the way we do our work, and hence must be built in the design curriculum. Students should do things with self-initiative. \r\n\r\nAccording to me, the top 3 things that are need in the students’ curriculum are:\r\n\r\n1.	Self discipline\r\n\r\n2.	Good story telling skills and\r\n\r\n3.	Amazing visual presentation skills.\r\n\r\n*What message do you have for the next generation of product designers?*\r\nToday, it’s not just about designing tangible things, but also move towards intangibles. Excellent styling is now taken as granted, but what you are designing is more important. Future generation of designers should be capable of identifying the users’ latent needs and turn them into wonderful experiences.\r\n\r\n*What do you think are the biggest challenges working in corporation?*\r\nDiscipline is needed and is very important. We as designers need to also master the art of selling an idea. We should be able to adjust to corporate culture and still be able to clearly express our thoughts.\r\n\r\n*In India, what are the key barriers for a designer to work in an industry?*\r\nThere are no barriers at all. I see all barriers as opportunities.\r\n\r\n*A day in your life 5 years from now...*\r\nI am living in a remote location, where my physical presence is not required for work, but I am able reach anywhere quick. \r\n\r\nI am a strategist, an innovator. Most of my services are at a strategic level, I am directing companies where they should be investing. These services are in the domain of innovation; inculcate innovation in employees & helping other innovate.\r\n\r\nI am collaborating with multifunctional activities, may be a toy company or a film-making institute.\r\n\r\n*Do you think your design will change the world?*\r\nI am not here to change the world. I intend to sensitize people to see and love small things in life. I want to create small wows!

It was time to branch out on my own.”\r\n\r\nSupported by wife Nilima, E Suresh set up the Studio Eeksauraus Productions Pvt. Ltd. The production house focuses on design, creative content development for both TV and cinema, pre-production and production of ads, short films and feature films. The fact that the entire team of 35 designers from the Famous House of Animation moved with him to realise this vision is testimony to Suresh’s cult status as an animation guru and a great leader.\r\n\r\nThe story started when Suresh passed out of the prestigious National Institute of Design, NID in 1997. “I had a completely different set of skills compared to traditional animation, which was the only prevalent form at that time in India. When we set up Famous in 1998, we had just one room to operate out of and we were doing whatever work came our way with crazy timelines,” remembers a nostalgic Suresh.\r\n\r\nFamous started by making Amar Chitra Katha into real animation films. But, he had to shelve that project and get into a self-sustaining way of running the company by getting into advertising films direction and production.\r\n\r\n“It was probably too early for animation coupled with poor awareness among broadcasters about animation as a medium” says Suresh, “perhaps we were thinking 10 years ahead of our time. Today, when I see Amar Chitra Katha as an animated series on Cartoon Network, I must say it is very badly done!”\r\n\r\n*What’s your contribution to the success of animation in India?*\r\n\r\nAnimation was rare in ad films in 1998, people understood only ‘Disney’ kind of animation. We broke many myths and people started accepting animation. We popularized animation in various types other than the ‘Disney’ kind of animation. That was one of the key achievements and a key strength of our company.\r\n\r\nTill some years back, animation was mainly used in children-oriented commercials and cartoons. We made the animated Amaron Battery commercials. It was for the first time people used animation as a marketing tool to target grown ups. That was path breaking!\r\n\r\nI don’t want to claim we started clay animation in the country because it’s a very old area.

But the moment they got into a scandal or a dip in their career, advertisers moved away from them. Animated characters are different!\r\n\r\nAnimation is classless, doesn’t have sex biases, and does not create any kind of status difference. Also, animated characters do not get into scams and scandals. So, you need not bother about whether a character would do a Tiger Woods!\r\n\r\n*What makes clients come to you?*\r\n\r\nClients found us as more like a design house rather than a film making house that trades skills for passion. We work very closely with our clients to find their requirements, their product’s reach, and their target groups.\r\n\r\nThey found us as a problem-solving bunch of people who could help find a solution through animation as a medium, rather than those who just make animation from the story provided.\r\n\r\nIt hasn’t been easy to convince clients; we always put in lot more effort than the usual. Seeing this kind of sincerity and focus, clients get interested in working with us. This is the impetus that has brought our company to this level.\r\n\r\n*Your company has received a lot of broadcasting awards. Is your company the best animation company out there?*\r\n\r\nWe are definitely at the top in terms of quality! But we are yet to make the mark in terms of team size and revenues!\r\n\r\nWe are not a cheap, third world animation BPO or do factory production kind of work. We are designers and problem solvers and we believe in developing our own content while maintaining highest standards of quality.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we would not mind growing into a large company of 600 people. As long as everyone is aligned to a singular goal of making fantastic animation content, it’s good. Having 600 people with conflicts in interests and goals is not growth.\r\n\r\nA good animation company must have animators who are complete film-makers. Animators must know everything from character design, storyboarding, animation and editing to sound design. Our studio holds screenings and artists are exposed to a wide variety of animated films. This helps motivate our people to excel at their work. The studio also holds theatre and drama workshops. Suresh asks “Afterall, if we don\'t know how to emote, how do we make our characters do the same?”\r\n\r\n*You talked about cheap animation BPO companies in India…*\r\n\r\nMany companies started outsourced animation work – a service model like a outsourced BPO operation. Foreign companies sent finishing work to India and the BPOs delivered it dirt cheap. Many animation BPO companies mushroomed all over the place but few survived.\r\n\r\nHave you looked at the way how design schools like NID produce animation designers? Every year only 10-15 animators come into the market from these good schools. This is not going to satisfy the huge demand in the market.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, local institutes that claim to teach animation, churn out poor quality kids. A few institutes started by animation studios are churning out better expertise in students, but even they need a giant leap in quality of education and output. With such poor quality of animation input, many animation companies who depended on these kind of people had to shut down!\r\n\r\nThe moment one company shut down, another came up and the cycle repeated. People kept moving from Cochin to Hyderabad to Pune to Mumbai, and so on. This kind of movement wiped out good talent. Now, a limited quantity of good talent is spread all over and they cannot do what they could have done staying together!\r\n\r\nKids need to understand animation properly and know what they want to do. It shouldn\'t be a shallow dive, they should look deep into what they want to do in animation. Do they want to be film makers or do they want to be specialists in a particular process? The threshold for people to call themselves animators has to be far higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n__(Click on these thumbnails to play)__','Interview','info@studioeeksaurus.com','','','www.studioeeksaurus.com',NULL,'suresh.eriyat','','','','','','','','','*What are the misconceptions about animation in the Indian film industry?*\r\n\r\nThere is low awareness about animation; however misconceptions are far bigger. People think that most animation work is done by computers. People always ask me – with computers you don’t have to work at all these days right? Even after many years, people only know animation as a term, but they don’t know how it is done.\r\n\r\nBollywood people think live action film directors can direct animation easily. Look at the international scenario where Spielberg has set up an animation company – Dreamworks, which produces animation films. But he has never bothered to direct animation films, although he is a brilliant director himself. He is intelligent enough to understand that and delegates responsibility to people who can do it better.\r\n\r\nHave you seen Shrek? Eddie Murphy doesn’t sound like Eddie Murphy when the donkey talks, does he? You believe that the donkey is expressing itself and that is its voice. You don’t imagine Eddie Murphy’s face talking that. That kind of talent has to evolve in India!\r\n\r\n*We heard that you met up the I&B minister recently. Why?*\r\n\r\nThe government does not realize the goldmine they are sitting on. We have been asking the Government of India to promote Indian animation industry. Unless the government is told, they’ll not be able to act on it. Do you expect them to know everything that is going on?\r\n\r\nDo you know that Japan’s largest industry is not steel but animation and Korea’s third largest industry is animation? A little bit of push from their side and this industry can flourish to be the strongest industries of the country.\r\n\r\nIn India, we have so much of talent, so many stories, and more than a billion people who not tuned to animation. So, if you are able to tune the audience into an animation savvy audience, you’ve got it all: a big industry and everyone will come here to showcase their work.\r\n\r\nWe acted like cry babies! We were a panel of 10 people from visual effects, animation and gaming industries who made a case to the minister. She was kind enough to give us ample time and talked to us in detail about the animation industry in India. She wants further proactive action from us too.\r\n\r\n*JAM*\r\n\r\n*Is there any particular unforgettable moment in your career that you would like to share?*\r\n\r\nI think this was in 1998-99, when we realized that the company that we are running is not going to work out and we probably might have to shut shop. I was working for Famous and there was a point when I was asked to shut shop overnight. We had 15 people I had to give an assurance to the management that I take it under me to find money to pay everyone.

After spending two years preparing for these, Satya gave up and declared to his parents that he did not want to become a doctor. “I used to spend 2 hours with those books and they would seem like 20!” Satya took up a course in Fine Arts at The College of Arts, Chandigarh. During his foundation year, he happened to meet some students from NID and realized his true calling.\r\n\r\n“It’s the love for letterforms and a romance that very few can understand. Not many designers understand typefaces,” confesses Satya. As far as Satya can remember, he had no intentions of becoming a type designer when he first considered a career in design. “Initially I wanted to get into animation!” During his foundation year at NID, after being sensitized to 2D forms, Satya decided what he wanted to do – Graphic Design.\r\n','2010-06-28 01:37:13','2010-08-24 19:30:27','Satya-Rajpurohit.jpg','image/jpeg',15648,'2010-06-29 22:07:25','If there is one word that best describes Satya Rajpurohit, it is modesty. Satya is the co-founder of Indian Type Foundry, a one of its kind firm that specializes in delivering quality Indic typefaces. For a country that has 9 major scripts, bring all the scripts under one umbrella is a Herculean task. But for young Satya this is his vision — A single type family for the whole of India.\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2158','During his 3rd year at NID, Satya sent some of his work to Linotype, Germany and landed an internship there. This was the turning point of his life. Since then Satya has not looked back. Type had infected him.\r\n\r\n“I had no time to think of doing anything else after this!” At Linotype, Satya was commissioned to design the Devanagri companion to Frutiger Sans. During this time, Satya got in touch with Bruno Maag in London via e-mail. Seeing his interest and quality of work in Devanagri typefaces, Satya was commissioned to design Tamil and Bengali companion to their InterFace Latin typeface family. Although he was not comfortable with Bengali and Tamil script at that time, he accepted this project.\r\n\r\n“I started studying the script from scratch, the same way a kid learns the alphabets!” After 4 months, Satya was finally ready to design the typefaces.\r\n\r\nWhile working at Linotype, Satya visited Peter Biliak’s studio in the Netherlands and presented some of his work and research findings. Peter offered Satya to design the Devanagri companion to Fedra Sans. After two years, Fedra Devanagari was complete and ready for release.\r\n\r\nReleasing a single Devanagri typeface under an established type foundry in Netherlands had many disadvantages. Both cost and quantity concerns led Satya to make an epic decision — set up a firm dedicated to designing typefaces exclusively for India — Indian Type Foundry. “Fedra Hindi was a good excuse to start the foundry,” confesses Satya.\r\n\r\n“I love letterforms. It is perhaps the best exercise a graphic designer can take up. It is an exercise that is purely form-based and heightens the sense of aesthetics, balance and contrast,” says Satya passionately.  “When someone uses my typefaces, it gives me a sense of happiness that I cannot describe! The first time I saw Fedra Hindi used in a magazine, I was really excited to see the typeface in those magazines.”\r\n\r\nAs the romance of Black and White continues, Satya is happy being stuck with it. Designing good typefaces is one thing, educating clients is another! “Not everyone understands the difference a good typeface can make,” complains Satya. “Also the time one spends in making a typeface is something most people do not understand.”\r\n\r\nSo what can we expect from Indian Type Foundry in the near future? Satya currently works out of Ahmadabad and has a few students working under him. They are designing a number of Indic typeface families including a giant family called Kohinoor Multiscript. This family will consist of good quality typefaces of all the 9 major scripts in India.\r\n\r\nWe wish Satya and Indian Type Foundry all the luck we can gather.\r\n\r\n*JAM (just a minute…)*\r\n\r\n*What is the best moment of the day?*\r\nMidnight.

','Rajesh Dahiya, founder of Codesign, believes in being a “many-handed” designer. While other designers have sleepless nights trying to carve out their “original” style, Rajesh will have sleepless nights if someone brands him in a particular style.\r\n\r\nChatting with DezineConnect, Rajesh recalls his NID days fondly. “NID is the most recallable 6 years of my life. I always felt I have come to NID with a large bag... large enough to collect things that I could learn. It’s like collecting fruits and interesting artifacts in a jungle.” And that’s what Rajesh did all his six years at NID – be it digging up information in the library or trying to catch up on technical know how of photography or working hard to get a repeat (sometimes)!\r\n\r\n“I was lucky to do my final project with Itu Chaudhuri design studio (It’s the most sought after design studio). I learned 3 important things from Itu-- Design, Systems thinking, Integrity. I dont know how to explain this... but I learnt how to think right.” He continued to work there for 2 years before being lured by the dot com boom in Bangalore. “I joined a health care portal and then Infosys soon after.” “Infosys was a nice place but I could not figure out what to do with my spare time. In the exit interview, they asked me why I was leaving, and I replied that my hands and mind were not occupied for 8 to 9 hours a day.”\r\n\r\nHis next destination was HFI as a usability specialist. “Honestly, I didn’t know much about Usability.” Here he realized that more technical knowledge he acquired, his vocabulary became insanely difficult to understand (at least by his friends), and eventually he moved away from the common man’s world. Fortunately, during this time, he received an email from professor MP Ranjan of NID about a new institute-- INteraction Design Institute, Ivrea, Italy. “I applied and was lucky to get a scholarship as well. That’s how Ivrea happened.” He fondly remembers the small town in Italy where he spent 2 years doing his masters. “It gave me good time to think who I was… I actually felt younger after I did my masters.”','2010-07-14 20:36:21','2010-08-24 16:38:27','rajesh-dahiya-forweb.jpg','image/jpeg',87275,'2010-07-20 21:45:46','Rajesh Dahiya, founder of Codesign, believes in being a “many-handed” designer.

He spent a year at NID talking to professors and students with all the user centric design knowledge that he had gathered in his bag of knowledge.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Rajesh had two options – a position with Volkswagen\'s design division called ‘Future of Dashboard Design’ and the other more tempting one was to start his own design studio. “All I had was a laptop and nothing else.” One fine day an architect friend called. There was a project from Levis interactive studio, but it had a catch. “Levis wanted to see my studio before they give me that project!”\r\n\r\nRajesh got going. A senior from NID offered to rent out a part of his studio. “All I had was 17000 rupees! He bought fine curtains that Rani no hajro, offered in Ahmadabad, 6 good coffee mugs and 9 plants. He wanted more designers for the project and that was easy to find within NID alumni network. Soon it was a 6 people studio, with PCs, finally when the client visited, the design team was ready. Rajesh had a good wine bottle that he got from Italy, he ordered pizza, and floored the client with his hospitality. “That’s how we got the project!” They completed the entire project in 4.5 months and ended up with 25000 rupees each at the end of the project. “I’m really thankful to all the people, nobody did that for money. It was really crazy... we had literally lived in the studio for the duration of the project! It was also one of our most covered project in the media.” That’s how Codesign was born. It was never planned! SInce its inception, two original members of team still remain-- I and Mohor Ray.\r\n\r\nCodesign name stood for “come together and design” (and also code+design).

We decided to co-locate in 2009 and now we work on projects as one team. Both the studios have common people on board.\r\n\r\nQuicksand started in 2005 as a collective of business, design and art - with a strong conviction that at the intersection of these disciplines lie more holistic & hence sustainable solutions. Since its inception, Quicksand has grown to accommodate more diverse disciplines of social development, research and technology and continues to champion the cause of multi-disciplinary collaborations as the way for more meaningful and sustainable work.. They wanted to do interaction design and collaborated with us. While working on a project we realized that we had similar thoughts, then we started working together with an new entity called BOX.\r\n\r\n*So is it Quicksand, Codesign & Box?*\r\n“We go to clients as BOX.” We take up projects based on each entity\'s specialization. For example, Quicksand takes on user research related projects and Codesign focusses on branding and communication design projects. I am slowly moving somewhere in the middle of two entities to support Ayush Chauhan (one of Quicksand\'s founders) while Mohor Ray, my partner, looks after branding projects in Codesign.  \r\n','*What does BOX do?*\r\n“Box is some kind of a frame work... a mental model for internal stakeholders and clients to understand us better.\r\nTalking about seeing collaboration as the future of Indian Design, Rajesh says “In our case, we dated Quicksand for 2 years before getting \'married\'. I am not wise enough to say anything about future of Indian Design and will not believe a single word from anyone who claims he/she can predict it. Whatever is generally predicted is boringly obvious (or obviously boring).... Someone stating \'Indian industry will need more designers by by so and so year\' or any such outrageously obvious and unimaginative statement should be kept away from media or any form of exposure.” \"Coming back to the question of collaboration... well, if two or more studios have unique skills then their collaboration can result in a truly multi-dsciplinary studio.\"\r\n\r\nExplaining the need for collaboration, Rajesh explains that it is nearly impossible to have excellent multi-disciplinary skills under one studio. Good designers need space, freedom and ownership after working for a few years as an \'employee\' in a studio. As studio should be able to incubate such deserving people. In BOX\'s current model, they have their own freedom, and everyone gets his or her own compartments of specialization. “So if we have to open one more entity we should be able to give the person the freedom to do that.”\r\n\r\n*Outside the studio space, our other initiatives are:*\r\n\r\nMOCHA ARTHOUSE provides a platform to emerging artists and new arts and questions existing elitist attitudes to art consumption. We intend to deviate from the gloss magazines’ idea of art galleries cordoning out everyone apart from the créme-de-la-créme.\r\nwww.mochaarthouse.com/wordpress/\r\n\r\nBLOT (Basic Love Of Things) is an established platform for independent content created by our studios across electronic music, art, film and artifacts. \r\nwww.blottin.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nBLIND BOYS is a \'photocommune\' - envisioned by Kapil Das as a collective of photographers that are ready to challenge the status quo of the creation and presentation of photography today.

There is a general distress in people…sensitivity and respect is missing.\r\n\r\n*If you were a typeface, which one would it be?*\r\nI am Akzidenz-Grotesk.

Luckily it has a quirky form and hence it did not become overused like Helvetica and therefore remains special.\r\n\r\n*If someone wrote a biography about you, what do you think the title should be?*\r\nI think biographies have to be reserved for people who have super cool achievements. I have not even started thinking on what I have to do in life. One has to have a direction to have a biography. I can’t have direction in life.

Very rarely would you come across someone who says, “I am still exploring!” And when you do come across such an individual, you are uncomfortable with the thought. Human beings by nature want to see certainties in life. They expect normalcy and constancy. But life is not about constancy; it is about flux and growth. It is about challenges and exploration.\r\n\r\nAnd we met one such explorer, Satyajeet. \r\n\r\nIf you ask Satyajeet what’s on his mind, don’t be surprised if he says, “Hmm! Let’s try something, let’s explore.” Deep down, we rejoice in the thought that we have met someone who is taking life head-on, someone who is creating and wading into the unknown. \r\n\r\nSatyajeet and exploration are synonymous. He is a designer who represents “inclusiveness” – a trait innate to the design process. \r\n\r\nSatyajeet’s journey truly started with a decision. This decision changed his life completely. He decided to learn printing technology instead of any other engineering subject. At that time, it may have been a risky decision, but not for Satyajeet, who loved exploring.\r\n\r\nAnd he did explore, and what a journey it turned out to be! When he started out with a course in printing technology, he encountered huge printing machines, print dyes and what not. Towards the end of the program, he realized that the existing designs are too cumbersome. He felt that the offset printing machine can be bettered and made smaller by a change in design.  And this thought helped him find his true calling. Without wasting further time, he joined NID. \r\n','2010-07-23 06:36:09','2010-08-24 21:46:30','SatyajeetKumar.jpg','image/jpeg',81020,'2010-07-23 06:36:09','When you ask young tyros what they want to become, you can often hear answers like doctor, actor, pilot, engineer and so on.

It is about challenges and exploration.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1695','At NID, Satyajeet used every bit of material, every user group discussion, and every problem area to learn more and expand his vision. Towards the end of the course he started taking keen interest in the business of design. \r\n\r\nHe understood that the Western mind with its chocolate wrapped colonialism influenced design education to a large extent. He felt that although design education prepared students like him to solve problems, there was a threat that they would end up following others rather than creating or leading on their own. That’s when he decided to be self-reliant and started contemplating on a business model.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t want to design for big brands, instead wanted to do something that he could truly call his own.  His rich mind envisioned many concepts that were sound in principles of design. He was however unsure where to start. And one fine morning as they say, “Topolate” was born.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo put simply, Topolate as an idea and a product is fun and light. \r\nSatyajeet understood that the product should help its user have an engaging experience. At the same time, he knew very well that while designing Topolate he could not compromise on quality. Every product based on the “Topolate” needed to be exceptional in quality and experience.\r\n\r\nThe idea for his first product came from one of his lighting experiments. Through the various experiments, he stumbled upon an idea to create a product that could produce uniform lighting of large surface through small fixtures. During his stint with NID, just before the pre diploma period, he continued experimenting. He was clear that the product idea was based on three core principles: product category, technology and raw material.\r\n\r\nEarly experiments with actual prototypes ran parallel to his diploma project. As he progressed, he developed his first product after 3 months.  The product itself was first of its kind in terms of technology, experience and style. With all that newness around the product, it was necessary for Satyajeet to remain focused on his goal of creating delightful products. \r\n\r\nTopolate was not a flash in the pan. It was a starting point for designs to emerge later. \r\n\r\nHis products cater mainly to designers, the community that he calls his own. He knows that to create designs, designers need space and freedom.  They hate restrictions and little irritants that take away their time. For example, getting the right kind of power supply cord, the right kind plug pin, or even the right lamp was important. Topolate provided a solution that is remarkable and simple to execute.  The Topolate environment has all of these things built into it.  The good part is that the product can be crafted to suit specific needs. Moreover, if the little things are not available, they were crafted and produced in-house. This explains why each piece that comes along with Topolate feels so fine.\r\n\r\nWhile Satyajeet was still experimenting with various packaging techniques and material for Topolate, people started recognizing his efforts and started paying attention. Immediately after finishing his diploma project, Satyajeet registered the product to market it commercially.  The early phase was hard, rigorous, and sometimes tiring. However, he was dilligent and did not allow his dedication to waver. \r\n\r\nSatyajeet gives credit to technology for the state of the art feel and finish of this hand-crafted product. He says “If not for the laser cut technology, I wouldn’t have been able to think of creating the very first product with high level of precision. Because laser cut was available, I could make it in the lines of a mass produced high class product.”\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Topolate is that it is handcrafted. Each piece is unique and of high quality. \r\nIt was during the animation film festival “Chitrakatha,” Satyajeet realized that although his product was outstanding and many people desired it, it was still not very affordable. This led him to make some little tweaks and create versions of Topolate.\r\n\r\nTopolate is now available in bent plywood and Aluminum and can be customized as per the requirement.  Handcrafted in a studio at Mithakali, Ahmadabad, the product is lit by uniform and controllable led powered light. Seeing is believing! When you see the product, you get an otherworldly feel of it. \r\n\r\nRight now, the studio has set small goals for itself. It wants to steadily increase its base by doing similar high quality, high class products. Satyajeet collaborates with a fellow designer Abhijeet and many more on project bases. Topolate is on its way to find more companions and grow its family. As this happens, Satyajeet remains vibrant, happy, enthusiastic and ready to experiment more. Never one to shy away, he says, “Let’s explore!”\r\n\r\n*JAM (just a minute…)*\r\n\r\n*If there were one person for whom you would like to design a thing.

So let’s hear from the dakus on how they started the whole journey.\r\n\r\n*How did you guys go about starting the business?*\r\n\r\nWhen we started designdaku, the easiest work that came our way was graphic design, and let me tell you we pretty much sucked at it but we got better. \r\n\r\nWe are three dabblers and we don’t see ourselves just as product designers. The idea behind designdaku was to create an umbrella that allowed us to do more things. We didn’t want to create a company where all of our time is spent in doing only one thing extremely well. We would rather do many things reasonably well, if not extremely well. All of us didn’t see ourselves specializing in only one discipline. This is the reason why we enjoy working and collaborating on various projects, which are beyond product design.\r\n\r\nYou should have a strong will to set up a multi-disciplinary design studio. Our first goal was to create a team that could support our idea. We had a fantastic time putting a team together that enjoys doing anything that’s thrown at us. It is amazing to see a fashion designer from NIFT doing cool graphics for a non-fashion client!\r\n','Interview','info@designdaku.com','9810574993 & 9999037532','','http://www.designdaku.com',NULL,'pages/designdaku/116908578327447','designdaku','','companies/228357','','','','*How did work start flowing in?*\r\n\r\nApeejay Surrendra Group was planning a flagship store for Oxford at the T3 terminal in Delhi airport. The brief from the client was to design a place that is different from any other retail space that we see anywhere else. That turned out to be our first project!\r\n\r\nProjects started flowing in from people whom we had worked together with earlier. We started getting more work when clients’ contacts moved to other companies. We also got work from friends and from client referrals.\r\n\r\nTill now we have done both of product design, branding and spaces - exhibitions, retail spaces. We have not done any user interface design work because we don’t have a technical team to do that.\r\n\r\n*How did you manage to learn about business?*\r\n\r\nWe are designers and we had no knowledge about business and management. We are from middle-class families and we had no idea how credit is different from debit. Obviously we were clueless about how a balance sheet looked like! These were challenges we grabbed with open hands and have overcome it over time.\r\n\r\nWe started by distributing the responsibilities among ourselves on a trial basis. But we were ready to exchange the roles if things didn’t work out. Luckily, we never had to switch roles.\r\n\r\nWhen we started calling and meeting people to pitch our services, we were surprised to know that people already knew about designdaku. We were also surprised by the visibility we got with our Facebook page along with extra-ordinary help from ex-colleagues and friends.\r\n\r\nAs design is not planned in the product lifecycle, the clients usually realize about its importance late. For us, whenever we interacted with clients, it has been more of a teaching than a design process. Also, we found it quite challenging to approach the clients in Delhi. For them design was all about coloring and beautification process with the help of DTP guys!\r\n\r\n*We have heard that you guys teach design in schools?*\r\n\r\nAs kids, we didn\'t know anything about design. We got to know about design during graduation. When we say design, students think about fashion design. Schools also concentrate on preparing students for IIT or AIIMS, but never design. That’s why we took up responsibility to make students aware about design. In fact, Sahil and Prabhat are actively engaged in teaching design in design schools. One of their interests is also to teach design in primary and secondary school level.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of money in the education domain, but that was never the motivator to teach.\r\n\r\n*Why Delhi?*\r\n\r\nPrabhat always wanted to move to Delhi, so we decided to move to Delhi. The moment we arrived, we figured out  the potential of the city.  Delhi, as you may know, is a hub for SMEs and they usually don’t approach large design firms. This turned out to be a big advantage for us.\r\n\r\nEven though designdaku started as a design consultancy, but with time we would like to move to products. Our passion lies in products. We would like to design products in various domains: lifestyle lighting solutions, fashion accessories, modified vehicles, or toys and games for students.\r\n\r\nFor us proximity with clients and vendors makes a huge difference and that also an advantage. When we plan our own range of products, we will have a set of potential vendors to work with.\r\n\r\n*Why don’t designers make and sell their own products?*\r\n\r\nMoney is a problem, but it’s a lesser problem. The bigger problem is understanding how business works. Its not that designers are not capable of understanding business but they are just not comfortable with it.  \r\n\r\nDesign entrepreneurs have the ability to look at a problem in various perspectives. Designers have a great future if they are willing to become entrepreneurs. The problems of seed money, office space, approaching VCs are slowly getting solved. Things are changing – incubators at NID and IDC are good places to start.\r\n\r\nWe believe that anything that happens in India happens despite the Government doing anything. Design stands where we as designers want it to be. There is nothing at a design policy level. \r\n\r\n*How do you approach design?*\r\n\r\nWe look around and we keep our eyes open. Sometime glaring light gives us insights. Inspiration comes from everywhere.\r\n\r\n*Where do you see yourself 10 years down the line?*\r\n\r\nIn 10 years we will be very rich. We will not consult unless clients come and ask us to do projects.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see a common man know about us by using a few products that we have designed for their day to day life.\r\n\r\n*Do you idolize any firms? Who is your favorite?*\r\n\r\nWe do not idolize any firms, but we like a lot of firms. We really like work done by Fukasawa Naoto and Droog Design.\r\n\r\nWe also like a small type foundry and graphic design studio called Studio on Fire. They do very impressive work in letterpress printing.\r\n\r\n*Do like anyone from India?*\r\n\r\nTo be very honest, there are very few. The only one we can think of is Satyendra Pakhale, but he doesn’t come from India. \r\n\r\nWe look up to Charles Correa and Christopher Charles Benninger for their work. We also like Manish Arora and Anuj Sharma in Fashion Industry. But in mainstream product design, we can’t think of any one.\r\n\r\n*What do you think of the quality of work of designers in India?*\r\n\r\nWe have seen lots of portfolios and largely we have been disappointed. Bigger names like NID and IDC have been consistently disappointing. On the other hand, we are impressed with students from Shristi, Bangalore. They are more inclined towards entrepreneurship. They are more prepared to try out new things. \r\n\r\nWe too were disappointing as students, but we want to employ people who can add value, and that’s missing. \r\n\r\n*Is there any message for design students?*\r\n\r\nStudents must have faith in their projects. There are many projects students complete each year. Projects just lie as reports and students leave it there. We would like to see students take these products and detail them. \r\n\r\nWe would like design institutes to encourage the students to take up these products and ensure they reach the market.\r\n','*JAM (just a minute…)*\r\n\r\n*What is the best moment of the day at designdaku?*\r\n\r\nFirst designer who enters the studio gets to play the music of his/her style for all the day.\r\n\r\n*If there were one person for whom you would like to design a thing. Who is the person and what would you design?*\r\n\r\nA motorcycle for Massimo Tamburini. His bikes are beautiful. But I would like him to go and buy a bike that’s designed by us.\r\n\r\n*One word that would define your style?*\r\n\r\nEvery work is different. There is no designdaku style. And we are not particularly happy with having a style.\r\n\r\n*As a designer, one thing that you would like to change in the present system?*\r\n\r\nCorruption and we don’t know how.\r\n\r\n*If you were an animated character, which one would it be?*\r\n\r\nWe already have a character for designdaku. We would like to see how animators interpret designdaku. We all like Abhishek Singh’s work and would love to see how he will design a character for us.\r\n\r\n*If someone wrote a biography about you, what do you think the title should be?*\r\n\r\nGames Dakus Play!\r\n\r\n*What are you afraid of regarding the future?*\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to be afraid of. But maybe its the cosmic scheme of things, it’s a creative person’s fear. When you’re gone, your thoughts go with you. How do you differentiate yourself from other designers?\r\n\r\n*What are the challenges you face in the present context?*\r\n\r\nMeeting everyone’s salaries at the end of month is the biggest challenge that we are facing right now.\r\n\r\n*One aspect of design you give the highest priority to?*\r\n\r\nEmpathy. It’s the biggest tool in the designer’s toolbox. To be able to put yourself in someone’s shoes to understand and design.\r\n\r\n*One design-related book you highly recommend to read?*\r\n\r\nThe art of looking sideways by Alan Fletcher. Its definitely recommended.\r\n','','');

I view the art of photography as a subtractive process, a distilling of reality into a personal vision. As such I often use the tools of modern photography – different film stocks, filters, digital enhancement – to try to capture in an image the emotions I felt at the moment I tripped the camera’s shutter.\r\n\r\nTwo of my great passions in life are travel and photography. I believe that travel broadens one’s view of the world. Experiencing other cultures, meeting people from other communities and other countries and seeing the beauty, and sometimes ugliness, of the world has helped me understand that all of our lives are at once interconnected and individual. It has made me better appreciate my own home and culture as well as that of the people I’ve met and the lands I’ve seen and I have become a much more tolerant person as a result.

Creating art & craft items with the use of wood have fascinated me from my very childhood and as of now when I moved in it, this became a real passion. Rectangular wooden wall art is one of the most popular choices, and it is no wonder why. The options for decorating with stylish rectangular works of art are virtually endless. When shopping for rectangular wooden wall art, come back often to Woodcraft to view the many options in our extensive category.
